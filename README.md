# Box of Mail

This is a protoype of the Mailbox app

It took ~12 hours to complete.

Completed user stories:
* On dragging the message left or right, icons are revealed (reschedule to the left, archive to the right)
* As the user drags further, the icon follows the message
* If a user drags to the right, the message disappears (being archived or deleted)
* If a user drags to the left they get later options for the message; if they choose an option, the message disappears
